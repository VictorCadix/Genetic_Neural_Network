## Presentation
This repository is a work in progress project made by @VictorCadix and @Raul6469. It is an implementation of a neural network which will learn with a Darwinian algorithm.

## How to execute
This project is built with Visual Studio Community 2017.

This repository contains two Visual Studio Projects :
- Neural Network 2 : the neural network itself
- UnitTestNeuralNetwork : the test program which works with the [Catch test library](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch)

You can build each of these solutions and execute within Visual Studio.
